# World of Warcraft Class Helper
The idea here is to give the user a quiz with several multiple-choice questions. When the quiz is finished, the user will receive a suggestion for which class to roll in World of Warcraft (WoW). 

## Disclaimer:
I am by no means a psychology expert, nor do I claim to be. The purpose of this quiz is to **_suggest_** a class based on a combination of your MBTI personality type and playstyle preferences. 

I'm aware of the debate over the validity of the MBTI personality test. Although many people agree that something as complex as personality could not be categorized in only 16 different types, including myself; I believe that someone could lean most towards a particular type that is also shared with a specific class. When taking that in addition to a players prefered playstyle into account, I believe you could find which 3, 2, or maybe even single class(es) suit(s) you best.

## Features: 
#### Version 1:
• I don't see a reason to recreate the wheel (or in this case the MBTI test), so a link to the site where you could take that test for free will be provided on the page. After having taken that test, you could return to the quiz and input your personality type.
    Testing out if the indentation works on markdown like so.

• After inputting your personality type, the following quiz will determine your playstyle. There will be several multiple-choice questions that relate to different traits of a class.
